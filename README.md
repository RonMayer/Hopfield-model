# Hopfield-model
this code explores hopfield model, which is a model of 100 neurons that are designed to "remember" a given number of memories via their connections (weights).
after the neurons' weights are determined for remembering 5 memories for example, if we present one of the memories with a certain amount of noise, the net should be able to recognize it.
we explore how the net's performance is affected by: the amount of memories stored, the amound ot noise at the presentation stage, and the type of noise (deterministic or random).
